	DustJS is only going to execute things asynchronously when the resources it needs to render (templates, partials) haven't already all been loaded.  If all the dependencies of a template are loaded before you execute that template then it'll execute synchronously (as far as I can tell anyhow).  So you can do something like:

    var result;
    dust.render("tpl", data, function(err, res) {
       result = res;
    });
    console.log(result); // result will actually already be filled out if dustjs didn't
    // have to go look for resources somewhere.

Here is a fuller example below:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="dust.js"></script>
	<script>
		var tpl = dust.compile("Omg {#people} {.} {/people} are here! {>partial/}", "tpl");
		var partial = dust.compile("I'm a partial but I've already been included so things still run {how}", "partial");
		dust.loadSource(tpl);
		dust.loadSource(partial);

		var data = {
			people: ["jim", "jane", "jack", "julie"],
			how: "synchronously!"
		};

		var result;
		dust.render("tpl", data, function(err, res) { 
			result = res;
		});
		console.log(result);
	</script>

There could be cases (besides the one I mentioned) where I'm wrong...  I don't know everything about dustjs.
